	<description>The Drune hail from the coastal city-states along the Emerald 
	sea. They came to Aneirin more than 300 years ago, attracted by the vast mineral 
	wealth. Today, they rule the island kingdom.
	
	The Drune are not a hardy folk, but they are skillful and intelligent 
	traders.</description>
